# academic-achievement-gap
This project was designed to highlight my data wrangling and storytelling capabilities through an exploration of data on schoolsâ€™ performance on end-of-year exams and county-wide poverty levels.

# Motivation 
Before I moved into the world of coding, I joined the non-profit organization "Teach for America" and taught elementary school for three years. The program's principle goal is to close the so-called "achievement gap" and end educational inequity. What this means in practice is that teachers only work in low-income schools across the United States - generally where at least 80% of students at a school receive Title I funding. I wanted to further explore the relationship between poverty and school performance in greater depth, using data from the U.S. Department of Education's EDFacts Initiative, U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates Program, and the U.S. Department of Education's Local Education Agency (School District) Universe Survey Data to answer the following question: Do students living in poorer communities perform worse on end-of-year reading and math tests?
