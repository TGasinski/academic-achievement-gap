# academic-achievement-gap
This project was designed to highlight my data wrangling and storytelling capabilities through an exploration of data on schoolsâ€™ performance on end-of-year exams and county-wide poverty levels.

# Motivation 
Before I moved into the world of coding, I joined the non-profit organization "Teach for America" and taught elementary school for three years. The program's principle goal is to close the so-called "achievement gap" and end educational inequity. What this means in practice is that teachers only work in low-income schools across the United States - generally where at least 80% of students at a school receive Title I funding. I wanted to further explore the relationship between poverty and school performance in greater depth in order to answer the following question: Do students living in poorer communities perform worse on end-of-year reading and math tests?

# Data Sources
Data was taken from the U.S. Department of Education's EDFacts Initiative, U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates Program, and the U.S. Department of Education's Local Education Agency (School District) Universe Survey Data. Two .csv files were too large to add to the /input folder, but they can be downloaded here: https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubagency.asp, https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2011/demo/saipe/2011-state-and-county.html and https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2012/demo/saipe/2012-state-and-county.html. (Note: It appears that the U.S. Census Department restructured its datafiles. When I originally downloaded the dataset, the 2011 and 2012 poverty estimates were combined into one file. Now, they exist in two separate files.) 

# How to use
To run both the Cleaning and Wrangling.ipynb and Graphs.ipynb files, download the /input folder files and first run the Cleaning and Wrangling.ipynb file. To only view the graphs, first download the /clean folder files.
